# CoolSoft-13 Wiki

You can access the wiki through the link in the toolbar, or just click here:
https://github.com/mnzaki/coolsoft-13-wiki/wiki

The main CoolSoft-13 repository that contained the code to the Idearator project
has since gone private. This repository exists only as an archive for the wiki
that we built during our Software Engineering course. It contains various
guidelines, tips and tricks, etc.

This wiki was used by various teams besides ours and stil remains to be useful
and is thus maintained here for more than just posterity reasons. As such I
request that changes and additions be contributed back to this repository via
pull-requests.

Some pages (few) were specific to our project at that time and are only left
there for sentimental reasons.

## Contributing
This repo itself is a mirror of its own wiki repo. Fork this repository, make
your changes, then pull request. I will accept pull requests and push the
changes to the actual wiki.
