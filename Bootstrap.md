We currently use the `bootstrap-sass` gem. Just merge master and `bundle install` and you are good to go.  
If you need to override something in the defined bootstrap classes, do so in the `app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss` file.

## Application Layout
FIXME spans, navbar, etc
